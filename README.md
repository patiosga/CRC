# CRC

This is a CRC simulative system that simulates data transmissions from sender to receiver. 
A certain number of messaging frames (packets) randomly produced bit by bit, is considered to 
be transferred with a predetermined probability to be altered during transmission. 
The algorithm uses the CRC technic to check if the receiver's packet is the same to the sender's one.
